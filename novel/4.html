A non-needy man will be more invested in himself than the woman he's with .</p> <p>funny. told us to change mind .because something is not our can change ,just be anther way to thoughts.god ,thx,wait to long .and do it ends up our life.</p> <p>take a moment to consider...
That before meeting a woman,instead of worrying whether or not she will like you,you could wonder if you will like her.
That instead of feeling the need to impress her, you could wonder if she impress you.
That instead of sitting there silently wondering what to say next to make her like you,you could sit there silently wondering what she will say to make you like her.
That instead of waiting around for her to call,you could find something or skinny enough,you could decide whether they're too superficial to recognize your great qualities.
That instead of trying to come up with the perfect date,you could decide that a woman who really like you for you doesn't need a perfect date.
That instead of looking for a conversation she'll enjoy,you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest.
only making time for people who make time for you.worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy.looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs.Changing yourself to become who you want to be,not what you think women want you to be.
Because,ironically,that is what women want you to be :a man who wants to be who he wants to be.</p> <p>think of it this way,there are two men. one stands tall,looks straight ahead.looks people in the eye when he speaks to them.says what he thinks and is comfortable if some people disagree with him .when he makes a mistake,he shrugs it off and apologizes if necessary. when he sucks at something.he admits it.he's unafraid to express his emotions,even if that means he gets reject him, but instead like him for who he is.</p> <p>the second man hunches over,his eyes dart around and he is unable to look someone in the eye without getting uncomfortable.he puts on a cool persona that is always aloof.he performs.he avoids saying things that may upset others,and sometimes even lies to avoid conflict.he;s always trying to impress people.when he make a mistake,he tries to blame others or pretend like it didn't happen.</p> <p>so one night,talking withe melina,i just went off -for like 15 minutes straight,about my stupid whore of an ex,and went into minute detail about all the fucked up stuff she did,just on and on and on .so bitter and hurt,so unnecessary. if finished, i hadn't even realized how long i had gone on rambling.then after an awkward silence,melina looked at me as if scared by something and calmly said:i probably didn't need to know all of that&quot; &lt;funny,did it before.hh&gt;</p> <p>men often used to ask me how to get a women to cheat on her boyfriend or husband. my answer has two parts.the first part is :you don;t ,they decide.the second part of the answer is :don;t fucking do it,what's wrong with you ?it contributes to the fucking of people's lives and even if it didn't,it's never worth the headache it cause.</p> <p>women who are unreceptive are just that:they're unavaliable and /or unintersted in having a sexual /romantic relationship with you .The most common reasons that put women in this category are the following:you're far needier than she is,and she's therefore not attracted to you .she has a boyfriend/husband and is happy in her relationship.there's to much friction preventing her from being willing to date you ,such as a difference in values,difference in interests,bad logistics,etc.she's not interested or looking for any man at the moment.</p> <p>if she shuts you down ,tells you to go away, tells you she;s not interested,tells you she has a boyfriend .move on .seriously,,get over it and move on .you're wasting your time .i don't care how special you think she is ,there's another one out there who's just as special who will be receptive to you.</p> <p>their perspective is that they are perfect man for her and one day when she wakes up and relizes how foolish she is,she'll realize that the love of her life had been sitting right there by her side all along.this never happens.ever.</p> <p>you should cold read as much as possible.any time you're asking a question that requires a factual answer,take a stab at the answer instead of asking.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
